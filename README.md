What is rootShell?
=========
rootShell is a program written completely in Ruby which is very similar to command prompt. 
All you do is type commands. The difference is, there will be commands cmd does not have.

What's happening currently?
=========
It's under development and I still have looong lines of codes to write :neckbeard:
Brace yourself for stupidity.

More?
=========
If you wish to see the old version of rootShell, here it is. It's completely raw and hard to read and also there are some bugs which have not been fixed.
pastebin.com/Fx1rgtKB - Old rootShell.

I can't possibly write all the commands cmd has to offer so I'll just add commands that are within my knowledge in Ruby.

Tell me something funny @ cyniclimbu@gmail.com
