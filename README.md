What is rootShell?
=========
rootShell is a program written completely in Ruby which tries to imitate command prompt. 
All you do is type commands. 

Help command isn't available at the moment :hushed: 

Please refer to pastebin.com/2WjxnuCh until help command is available. :grimacing:

What's happening currently?
=========
It's still under development. I have looong lines of codes to write and tons of ideas to dream about. 
Brace yourself for stupidity. :neckbeard:

More
=========
If you wish to see the old version of rootShell, here it is. 
It's completely raw and hard to read and also there are some bugs which have not been fixed.

pastebin.com/Fx1rgtKB - Old rootShell. (Mind you I failed before I could even finish old rootShell)

Usage instruction: 
Install gems rootshell uses which your compiler does not have and then open rootShell.rb, follow instructions presented on the shell. :ok_hand:
Too see the list of gems rootshell uses check rootshellgemfile.rb
colored gem isn't listed there just so you know.

Last but not least
=========
I failed twice, big time, to bring this project to life and I do believe that failing is the best thing that can happen to you as the next time you try it will be better than your previous try. 

I'm open to any kind of comments so if you have anything to say from features, corrections to suggestions you can send me an email at cyniclimbu@gmail.com
