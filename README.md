The aim for this project is nothing.
The process is all about research and put the research together. I did learn some few things and I still am.

As of 17 Nov, everything planned for this project has changed. So I'll replace all the codes ASAP!

Installation method is completed.
All there is left is command_structure.rb
Which will contain commands similar to windows command prompt.

I'm adding my own commands too. There are about 10-12 commands completed, once I have about 30 or so, I'll commit it to github.

Who even bothers to read this anyway?
I'm on my own.
